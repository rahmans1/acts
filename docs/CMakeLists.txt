# to be compatible with readthedocs.org, the documentation build is always
# in-source; as opposed to the configurable out-of-source build directory for
# the code. when running running on readthedocs.org, the build is fully driven
# by Sphinx, including running Doxygen.
#
# this CMake-based build is only intended for local development. Doxygen is
# run separate from Sphinx to avoid running it when no code has change. since
# the full documentation with automatic generation of API docs take O(10mins)
# to build, the default `docs` target does not include the API docs generation
# but includes the Sphinx-Doxygen integration (breathe).
#
# the full documentation as on readthedocs.org can be build via the additional
# `docs-with-api` target.
#
# WARNING: after you ran `docs-with-api` the regular `docs` target will
#          accidentaly pick up the auto-generated api files. remove the
#          `_build` and the `api` directory manually to avoid this.

# this should match the INPUT declaration in the Doxyfile
# CONFIGURE_DEPENDS ensures that adding/removing files leads to reprocessing
